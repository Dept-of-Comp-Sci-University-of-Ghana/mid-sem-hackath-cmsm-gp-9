# Mental Health Detection

This repository contains the code for Group 9's midsem hackathon project in Computational Models for Social Media Mining. The goal of this project is to develop a system that detects mental health issues from social media data.

## Installation

To set up the project and install the required dependencies, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Create a virtual environment for the project. Using a virtual environment is recommended to isolate the project's dependencies. Run the following command to create a virtual environment:

> ```python -m venv myenv```
Replace myenv with the desired name for your virtual environment.

3. Activate the virtual environment. The command to activate the virtual environment depends on your operating system:

- For Windows:
  
```myenv\Scripts\activate```

- For macOS/Linux:

```source myenv/bin/activate```

1. Install the project dependencies by running the following command:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```
